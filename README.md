# Polar graph editor
Roberto Toro, May 2019

We have been generating a lot of graphs representing folding patterns. To view the graphs we flatten them. But just flattening doesn't work nice. Instead, we flatten them over a sphere, and then we use a polar stereographic projection to flatten them to 2D.

This editor projects the 2D flat polar projections using curves for the edges instead of just straight lines. It also allows one to displace the graph nodes to improve the graph layout.

There is one sample graph: `sample.graph.txt`.
